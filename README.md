# PONG
A simple game of pong in the terminal using ncurses library in C++.

Use `make` to compile. `make run` or `bin/main` to run.
Somewhat based on [Pong](https://github.com/zacharyvincze/Pong), but with some improvements in layout and I tried to make it more object oriented.

## Finished version 1.0

### Some To-Do's
* Add sound
* Increase speed as game advances, whether each point, or with time, or a number of bounces.
